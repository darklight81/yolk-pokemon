## README
The app loads pokemon from `pokeapi.co` and shows them as Pokemon cards.

### Functionalities
- Possibility to load more pokemons
- Client-side search from the already fetched pokemon
- Toggling the back/front of all of the cards
- Client-side filtering by the type of the Pokemon

It uses Next.js. For the CSS I decided to go with SASS.

### How to run the app
- Clone the repo
- Install dependecies `npm install`
- Run the app `npm run dev`
- Go to `localhost:3000` to see the results
